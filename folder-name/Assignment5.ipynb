Recall that the command x=uniform(0,2) generates a random real number x between 0 and 2 which is uniformly distribute (this means that all real numbers between 0 and 2 are equally likely to come up). Thus, x^2 is a random real number between 0 and 4. Larry claims that half the time, x^2 will be less than 2 and half the time x^2 will be greater than  2. Mary thinks Larry is mistaken.
